Systems can sometimes infer this from the packaging.type (e.g. bottles are containers, bottle caps are not), or from the fact that a container will usually have other items within it (though it is possible that these exist but are not mentioned). Often the distinction is not critical - and can easily be understood by humans - but if that is necessary for machine processing it is recommended that this attribute is given a value.","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"PackagedProductDefinition.packaging.componentPart",0,1,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}
